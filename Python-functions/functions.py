"""
A function is basically just a collection of code, which performs a specific task.
And then when we want to do that task, we can just call the function.
Functions help you to organize your code a lot better, they allow us to break up 
our code into different little chunks that are doing different things. 
Functions are a very core concept when we're talking about programming in Python.
